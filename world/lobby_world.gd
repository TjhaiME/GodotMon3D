#we want to have a single player world that works nicely and intuitively
#with it giving contexts to battles
#have a world map heightmap, so a long distance version of the mapp can be rendered
#then here we have various scenes loacl that can be added to.
#then we can have easy teleporters

#no need to have trainers yet, we could do mystery dungeon style
#if we talk to people and then we have a menu we dont want to have to use the mouse for the menu
#can we make a mesh menu thats controllable so that it recieves handle_input()?

#when press interact on talkable npc
#spawn a mesh at the players camera
#spawn the ui etc
#handle control over to the ui and listen for the input
